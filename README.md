## About Me

I‚Äôm a recent grad with a Master‚Äôs in Engineering Management and 4.5 years of hands-on experience as a Quality Specialist. I specialize in improving throughput and consistency through data-backed process improvements, Lean tools (5S, SMED, SPC), and structured problem solving (Root Cause Analysis, CAPA). I own the end-to-end execution: identify gaps, design intervention, implement, and verify results.

## Key Projects / Case Studies

### 1. **Reducing Setup Time with SMED**
- **Problem:** Long changeover times were hurting throughput on critical equipment.  
- **Action:** Conducted a Gemba walk, mapped current changeover steps, separated internal vs. external tasks, and implemented quick-change tooling practices (SMED).  
- **Result:** Reduced setup time by **35%**, enabling an additional 2 production runs per week and improving overall equipment effectiveness (OEE).

### 2. **Root Cause Analysis on Quality Variation**
- **Problem:** Frequent variation in product specifications causing rework.  
- **Action:** Used Pareto analysis, collected SPC data, performed fishbone diagramming, and identified inconsistent operator procedures and equipment drift. Standardized work instructions and added control chart monitoring.  
- **Result:** Defects dropped by **60%**, saving estimated 120 labor hours per month.

### 3. **Lean Flow Creation and Line Balancing**
- **Problem:** Bottlenecks causing uneven load and idle time.  
- **Action:** Time-studied each station, rebalanced tasks across operators, introduced visual kanban for WIP limits, and created future-state value stream map.  
- **Result:** Increased cycle efficiency by **22%** and reduced lead time by **15%**.
