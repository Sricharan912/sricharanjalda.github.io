### 🚀 How it works

1. **Fork/clone** this repo to edit your own profile.  
2. Drop your **`resume.pdf`** in the root.  
3. Hit **Commit & Push**—GitHub Pages (or your profile) auto-renders it.  

Feel free to question anything—this is your digital handshake.  
Traditional resume? Sure. But hosting it live on GitHub? That’s future-ready.
